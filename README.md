# Functional Programming Interpreter
## Overview
This project is a functional programming interpreter developed as part of a final project for the Programming Language course under Dr. Sharon Yalov-Handzel. The interpreter is designed to handle a simple functional programming language that supports function definitions, lambda expressions, recursion, and various operations, while enforcing immutability and avoiding variable assignments.

# Features
* # Data Types
  * **INTEGER:**  Supports whole numbers(e.g., -3, 0, 42).
  * **BOOLEAN:** Supports 'True' and 'False'.
* # Operations
   * **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition ('+'), Subtraction ('-'), Multiplication ('*'), Division 
('/'), and Modulo ('%').
   * **Boolean Operations:** AND ('&&'), OR ('||'), NOT ('!').
   * **Comparison Operations:** Equal to ('=='), Not equal to ('!='), Greater than ('>'), Less than ('<'), Greater than or equal to ('>='), Less than or equal to ('<=').
* # Functions
  * Support for named function definitions and anonymous functions (lambda expressions).
  * Function application, including support for higher-order functions.
  * Recursive function calls, including support for replacing traditional while loops.
  
 * # Immutability
   * No variable assignments or state changes

# Acknowledgements
 * Dr. Sharon Yalov-Handzel for guidance and support throughout the course and this project.
